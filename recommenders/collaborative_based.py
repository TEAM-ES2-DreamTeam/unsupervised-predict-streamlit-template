    Note:
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------
    Please follow the instructions provided within the README.md file
    located within the root of this repository for guidance on how to use
    this script correctly.

    NB: You are required to extend this baseline algorithm to enable more
    efficient and accurate computation of recommendations.

    !! You must not change the name and signature (arguments) of the
    prediction function, `collab_model` !!

    You must however change its contents (i.e. add your own collaborative
    filtering algorithm), as well as altering/adding any other functions
    as part of your improvement.

    Description: Provided within this file is a baseline collaborative
    filtering algorithm for rating predictions on Movie data.
